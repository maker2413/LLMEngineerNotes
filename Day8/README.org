In our previous project, we used LangChain and learned about the RAG to
implement a Q&A AI assistant that pulled data from a vertex database we
populated. Now we are going to be building a resume and cover letter helper
using Pydantic

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp :exports none :results none
  (setq org-babel-python-command (concat
                                  (file-name-directory (or load-file-name (buffer-file-name)))
                                  ".venv/bin/python"))
#+END_SRC

#+begin_src python :exports none :results none
  # This file was generated from the README.org found in this directory
#+end_src

In this section we are going to learn a super powerful library called Pydantic
that allows us to perform output validation.

* Project overview
  In this project, we'll build a "Resume AI Assistant" which uses the power of
  LLMs like OpenAI's ChatGPT, Google's Gemini, and Pydantic to help job seekers
  tailor their resumes and generate custom cover letters for specific job
  applications.

  Example:
  - *Input*:
    - Old Resume
    - Target Job Description
  - *Output*:
    - Gaps/Mismatch between resume & job Description
    - Potential strengths
    - Match % Score
    - New Resume with gaps addressed
    - New tailored cover letter

* Key learning outcomes
  This section will have us:
  - Build a powerful AI resume editor that can identify gaps between resume and
    the job description and tailor the resume and cover letter.
  - Master Pydantic library for output validation.
  - Learn how to generate parsed structured output from OpenAI with Pydantic.
  - Learn how to develop a text change tracker using OpenAI.

* Use case for Pydantic library
  Pydantic is a Python library used to validate and parse data using Python type
  hints. It ensures that the data you get is clean, well-structured, and follows
  the rules you set.

  How it works:
  - You define a data structure using a class.
  - Pydantic ensures the data is correct (types, required fields, etc.).
  - It even converts data automatically if possible (e.g., turns strings into
    numbers or dates).

  To begin we will import the Pydantic library:
  #+name: pydanticimport
  #+begin_src python :results none :exports both
    # Let's install and import Pydantic
    # In Pydantic, BaseModel is the core class that you use to create data models.
    # BaseModel is like a blueprint for structured data. It defines the fields, their types, and automatically gives you data validation and type conversion capabilities
    from pydantic import BaseModel
  #+end_src

  To begin with Pydantic we can simple define a class we will be using to
  validate our data:
  #+name: userclass
  #+begin_src python :results none :exports both
    # Let's create a new class named "User"
    # BaseModel is a special class from Pydantic that performs validation and parsing
    # Inside the class, we will declare name, age, and email along with their expected data types using Python type hints
    # Pydantic's role is to validate that name is a str, age is an int, and so on.
    # If you pass something wrong (like a string instead of a number), Pydantic raises an error.

    class User(BaseModel):
        name: str
        age: int
        email: str
  #+end_src

  Now let's test it out with a valid input:
  #+name: debuguserclass
  #+begin_src python :results output :exports both :tangle no
    # Let's test it out with a valid (correct) input 
    try:
        user = User(name = "Mira", age = 30, email = "mira@gmail.com")
        print(user.model_dump_json())

    except Exception as e:
        print(e)
  #+end_src

  We can see that we successfully get:
  #+RESULTS: debuguserclass
  : {"name":"Mira","age":30,"email":"mira@gmail.com"}

  Now let's test it out with a invalid input:
  #+name: debuguserclass2
  #+begin_src python :results output :exports both :tangle no
    # Let's test it out with an invalid input 
    try:
        user = User(name = "Mira", age = "not-a-number", email = "mira@gmail.com")
        print(user.model_dump_json())

    except Exception as e:
        print(e)
  #+end_src

  Here we can see we caught an error:
  #+RESULTS: debuguserclass2
  : 1 validation error for User
  : age
  :   Input should be a valid integer, unable to parse string as an integer [type=int_parsing, input_value='not-a-number', input_type=str]
  :     For further information visit https://errors.pydantic.dev/2.12/v/int_parsing

* Generate parsed structured output
  Now we will attempt to generate parsed structured output from OpenAI with
  Pydantic. To begin we will load our API Keys similar to how we have done
  before:
  #+name: loadapikeys
  #+begin_src python :results output :exports both
    # Import necessary libraries
    import os
    import google.generativeai as genai
    from openai import OpenAI  # Make sure you have the latest openai package (pip install --upgrade openai)
    from dotenv import load_dotenv
    import json

    # Importing type hints that help describe what kind of data your Python functions or classes expect or return.
    # List: A list of elements, all usually of the same type.
    # Example: List[int] means a list of integers like [1, 2, 3].

    # Dict: A dictionary (key-value pairs).
    # Example: Dict[str, int] means keys are strings and values are integers like {'a': 1, 'b': 2}.

    # Union: Either one type or another.
    # Example: Union[int, str] means the value can be an int or a str.

    # Optional: Means a value can be the type you expect or None.
    # Example: Optional[int] is the same as Union[int, None].

    # Any: Anything at all — no restriction on type.
    # You can pass an int, string, list, object, etc.
    from typing import List, Dict, Union, Optional, Any
    from IPython.display import display, Markdown

    print("Libraries imported successfully!")

    # Load environment variables from the .env file
    load_dotenv()

    # Fetch API keys from environment variables
    openai_api_key = os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")
    google_api_key = os.getenv("GOOGLE_API_KEY")

    # Configure the APIs
    openai_client = OpenAI(api_key = openai_api_key)
    genai.configure(api_key = google_api_key)

    # Initialize the Gemini model, choose a suitable model like "gemini-2.0-flash"
    gemini_model = genai.GenerativeModel("gemini-2.0-flash")
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS: loadapikeys
  : Libraries imported successfully!

  Now let's define a new class we will be using:
  #+name: scientistclass
  #+begin_src python :results none :exports both
    # Let's define a Pydantic model called scientist that describes what a valid response should look like
    class scientist(BaseModel):
      name: str
      field: str
      known_for: list[str]
      birth_year: int
  #+end_src

  Now we can define our prompt we will use:
  #+name: prompt
  #+begin_src python :results none :exports both
    # Let's define a prompt
    prompt = """
    Give me a JSON object with details about a famous scientist.
    Include the following fields: name, field, known_for, and birth_year.
    """
  #+end_src

  Now let's test our prompt:
  #+name: debugprompt
  #+begin_src python :results output :exports both :tangle no
    # Let's make the API call to OpenAI
    # Note that we used "openai_client.beta.chat.completions.parse( )" since we want to parse it into a structured output instead of just plain text 
    response = openai_client.beta.chat.completions.parse(model = "gpt-4o",
                                                     messages = [{"role": "user", 
                                                     "content": prompt}],
        temperature = 0,
        response_format = scientist,  # This tells OpenAI to return a parsed `scientist` object that's defined by Pydantic
        max_tokens = 300)

    # Print the parsed response
    print(response.choices[0].message.content)

    # Use json.loads() to turn the Json into a Python dictionary
    print(json.loads(response.choices[0].message.content))
  #+end_src

  This gives us:
  #+RESULTS: debugprompt
  : {"name":"Albert Einstein","field":"Theoretical Physics","known_for":["Theory of Relativity","Photoelectric Effect","Mass-Energy Equivalence (E=mc²)","Brownian Motion"],"birth_year":1879}
  : {'name': 'Albert Einstein', 'field': 'Theoretical Physics', 'known_for': ['Theory of Relativity', 'Photoelectric Effect', 'Mass-Energy Equivalence (E=mc²)', 'Brownian Motion'], 'birth_year': 1879}

* Define the inputs
  Next we will define the LLM inputs including the resume and target job
  description.

  Now that we covered the basics of Pydantic, let's start with our project! We
  need to get the user's resume and the target job description. We'll start by
  defining these as multi-line strings in Python. Later in the course, we will
  adopt this to take user input or read from files.

  How can we make it this far without our glorious print function:
  #+name: printmarkdown
  #+begin_src python :results none :exports both
    # Helper function to display markdown nicely 
    def print_markdown(text):
        """Displays text as Markdown."""
        display(Markdown(text))
  #+end_src

  For testing later we will want a sample resume so let's just define that now:
  #+name: sampleresume
  #+begin_src python :results none :exports both
    # Let's define a sample resume text
    resume_text = """

* Enhance the resume with OpenAI
  Now that we have our test resume and test job description, let's use the
  OpenAI API to improve the resume to better match the job requirements. We'll
  make a call to the text generation API and ask it to enhance our resume.

  To begin we will define a function to have OpenAI generate content for us:
  #+name: funcopenaigenerate
  #+begin_src python :results none :exports both
    def openai_generate(prompt: str,
                        model: str = "gpt-4o",
                        temperature: float = 0.7,
                        max_tokens: int = 1500,
                        response_format: Optional[dict] = None) -> str | dict:
        """
        Generate text using OpenAI API

        This function sends a prompt to OpenAI's API and returns the generated response.
        It supports both standard text generation and structured parsing with response_format.

        Args:
            prompt (str): The prompt to send to the model, i.e.: your instructions for the AI
            model (str): The OpenAI model to use (default: "gpt-4o")
            temperature (float): Controls randomness, where lower values make output more deterministic
            max_tokens (int): Maximum number of tokens to generate, which limits the response length
            response_format (dict): Optional format specification
            In simple terms, response_format is optional. If the user gives me a dictionary, cool! 
            If they don't give me anything, just assume it's None and keep going."

        Returns:
            str or dict: The generated text or parsed structured data, depending on response_format
        """

* Gap analysis

* Change tracking with Pydantic
  Now, we'll use the insights gained (analysis and suggestions) to generate a
  completely rewritten, tailored resume using OpenAI. A key enhancement here is
  to ask the AI not just to list the changes, but to try and identify which
  sections or areas of the resume were modified. This helps the user quickly see
  the impact of the tailoring.

  We'll ask the AI for two outputs:
  1. The full text of the tailored resume.
  2. A structured list (using Markdown) describing the key changes and where
     they were made (e.g., Summary, Experience section, Skills).

  #+name: pydantic
  #+begin_src python :results none :exports both
    # Define Pydantic models for structured output
    # The ResumeOutput class is a Pydantic model that defines the structure of the output
    # for the resume generation function. It includes two fields:
    # (1) updated_resume: A string that contains the final rewritten resume.
    # (2) diff_markdown: A string containing the resume's HTML-coloured version highlighting additions and deletions.

    class ResumeOutput(BaseModel):
        updated_resume: str
        diff_markdown: str

        ### Context:

        ---

        ### Instruction:
        1. Rewrite the entire resume to best match the **Target Job Description** and **Gap Analysis to the Job Description**.
        2. Improve clarity, add job-relevant keywords, and quantify achievements.
        3. Specifically address the gaps identified in the analysis by:
           - Adding missing skills and technologies mentioned in the job description
           - Reframing experience to highlight relevant accomplishments
           - Strengthening sections that were identified as weak in the analysis
        4. Prioritize addressing the most critical gaps first
        5. Incorporate industry-specific terminology from the job description
        6. Ensure all quantifiable achievements are properly highlighted with metrics
        7. Return two versions of the resume:
            - `updated_resume`: The final rewritten resume (as plain text)
            - `diff_html`: A version of the resume with inline highlights using color:
                - Additions or rewritten content should be **green**:  
                `<span style="color:green">your added or changed text</span>`
                - Removed content should be **red and struck through**:  
                `<span style="color:red;text-decoration:line-through">removed text</span>`
                - Leave unchanged lines unmarked.
            - Keep all section headers and formatting consistent with the original resume.
