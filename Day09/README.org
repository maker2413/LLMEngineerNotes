In our previous projects, we used pre-trained LLMs off-the-shelf models. Now,
let's dive into fine-tuning pre-trained LLMs to perform exceptionally well on a
specific task and dataset.

  (setq org-babel-python-command (concat
                                  (file-name-directory (or load-file-name (buffer-file-name)))
                                  ".venv/bin/python"))

In this section we are going to learn a super powerful library called Pydantic
that allows us to perform output validation.
